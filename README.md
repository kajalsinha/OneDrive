========

A Framework API where all Cloud Services (SkyDrive, DropBox, Box, Google Drive etc) lands up and provide a common interface to which a client system can interact.


Currently the implementation is in CSharp for Windows 8 Modern UI and I am looking forward to do a 'real' port for non windows platform as well. 

The current implementation works good for SkyDrive but requires further integration with DropBox or any other cloud provider.

The download manager still got bugs which requires fix.

The test application remains blank so do your stuff of adding a ref and using the APIs there if you wish to use this framework (I will update it later to include basic use).

I work on this project during free time (weekends mostly), I can provide more frequent updates if other developers find it useful.

Please let me know your feedback and comments, you are welcome!

Thanks
